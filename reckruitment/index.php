<h4 class="mb-2">Tips for Reckruitment</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Be yourself! We want to get to know you and why you love Georgia Tech!</li>
    <li>Have fun! The socials and "Get To Know You" events will have fun activities and should not feel like an interview; that's what the interview is for.</li>
    <li>Meet as many members as possible across the socials and "Get To Know You" events. Don't be afraid to ask a member you already know to introduce you to someone new.</li>
    <li>Put time and effort into your application. Follow the suggested word counts for each question to make sure you answer it fully.</li>
    <li>For any Reck Club Reckruitment event, wear something that you feel comfortable and confident in! There are no specifications on dress code for info sessions and GTKYs, but semi-formal attire is expected for interviews and both Social 1 and Social 2. If you would like assistance with clothing, <a href="https://www.campuscloset.gatech.edu/" target="blank">Georgia Tech's Campus Closet</a> provides this service free of charge to students!</li>
</ul>
