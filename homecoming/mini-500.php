                               unique traditions put on by Ramblin’ Reck Club since 1969. Teams consist of seven members: four 
                               racers and three pit crew who are responsible for maintenance and tire rotations. Each team is 
                               required to rotate their front tire three times throughout the course of the race, typically 
                               following the second, fourth, and sixth lap. All teams attempt to complete all 8 laps as quickly 
                               as possible without destroying their tricycle.'

               The event itself has been moved from Peters Parking Deck to the track around the Stamps Recreation Fields. This change will allow for entrance monitoring of participants and spectators. Every person entering the premises will have a standard temperature check and must be wearing a face covering.

               To limit the amount of teams racing at one time, only four teams will race at a time in a time trial fashion. Each team will start at opposing sides of the field and 4 racers from each team will compete. Racers will complete a half lap before sanitizing their trikes and passing it along to the next rider. Every team will compete two laps around the track!

               We are excited to be able to adapt the Mini 500 to keep everyone involved safe. If you are interested in competing in the Mini 500 this year please fill out the form here: <a href="https://forms.gle/LCZJM4VhE3tvF3Sh8">Mini 500 Form</a>. Stay safe and race on!
