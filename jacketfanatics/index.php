            <h2>What is the Jacket Fanatics program?</h2>
            <p>The Jacket Fanatics program is a Ramblin' Reck Club initiative designed to celebrate and strengthen Georgia Tech school spirit through engagement with Tech's Athletics. Jacket Fanatics encourages students to attend sporting events, participate in spirit activities, and actively support Yellow Jacket teams across campus.
            </p>
            <p>By tracking your attendance at Tech athletic events and completing fan milestones, you can be recognized for your dedication to Georgia Tech Athletics while helping build an energetic, united fan culture in our stadiums, arenas, and beyond. Jacket Fanatics is about more than cheering from the stands… it's about creating lifelong fans who carry Tech pride well past graduation!
